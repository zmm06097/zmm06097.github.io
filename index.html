 <h2 style= "text-align:center">ABOUT ME</h2>
 <p>Hello weary internet traveler (and/or CSCI 1100 TA), if you have located this page
  then it means you are prepared to enter a world of secondary self loathing and nihilism.
My name is Zach Mildren, and at the <time datetime="2018-11-25 14:28">time of writing this</time>, I am a third year psychology major with no intention of actually doing anything
with said degree. I'm enrolled in this course because the nice advisor lady told me it was
either this or calculus and you can rest assured that I have some undiscovered form of math dyslexia, so here I am.

<p>(For further information about me, please reference <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappointment">this page</a> that my parents set up for me.)</p>

<h2 style= "text-align:center">UGA</h2>
<p>Ok so this place is actually pretty neat, I (a grown person) have barked, like a dog, at other grown people in the name of this school. 
While I have been morally broken by the curriculum of this establishment, I'm too invested (emotionally and financially) to leave now. 
Here are some of the things that make this school so great:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>1. It's not Georgia Tech.</dt>
	<dd>Tech has a depressing campus and is full of insufferable snobby nerds.</dd>
	<dt>2. It's not Tennessee.</dt>
	<dd>That disgustingly bright orange speaks for itself.</dd>
	<dt>3. We have a dog as our mascot.</dt>
	<dd>Our good boy is the crown jewel of this institution.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 style= "text-align:center">FAILED CAREER PATHS</h2>
<p> Outlined below are the various directions that I thought I could take my life, with more of my soul being destroyed as the list progresses. 
I don't know where life will take me when everything is said and done, but I'm sure it will be underwhelming regardless.</p>
